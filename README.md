# BomberGame
A project for a small network game, containing a server and a client.

The game is run from the 2 files from the folder: src/game/
Server.java
Client.java


The Server needs to be run first, it will control the map and informations about the game, like the score and player placement. When it is run, it will give you the IP address that is used by the client to find the correct server and let you choose the map that is to be played on.
The client can then be run multiple times, or from multiple computers. You will need to type in either the IP address or choose local computer. Then choose your Player name and the game will start.
